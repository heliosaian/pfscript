  version of this file as well as information on unreleased versions of Dialog
  Studio.
  
12/30/2002 - 1.0 final (mIRC 6+)
1.  Improved consistency in message box information/warnings/errors.
2.  Fixed bug when changing ID of a control to one used by a control on a tab.
    It wouldn't let you, but it wouldn't tell which control was using it either.
3.  When adding new controls, the next available ID is chosen.
4.  Fixed properties not being saved if you changed from the Object Browser to
    another window without pressing Enter first.
5.  Fixed dialogs and windows not being sized properly under large fonts.
6.  Fixed text displaying on top of scrollbars in edit boxes.
7.  Fixed menus not being removed properly in all situations when creating a new
    project.
8.  Now using the same status window for loading projects and importing.  Shows
    a little more info than before, and can be shown at any time by going to
    Windows > Status Window.  Added option to automatically hide after loading
    project.
9.  Added support for undocumented 'flat' style for check boxes and radio
    buttons.
10. Fixed hot-tracking repaint bug.
11. Added a simple help/documentation window.  Requires IE5+ to be installed.

  
2/17/2002 - 1.0 beta 8a (mIRC 6+)
1.  Fixed mIRC crash when previewing if Initialization Warning was enabled in
    mIRC.
2.  Fixed Menu Editor being excessively large when first running Dialog Studio.
    If the Menu Editor seems to be acting very strange, go to dstudio.ini, down
    to the [Windows] section, and delete the line that has "MenuEditor=" on it.
3.  Fixed preview sometimes not working after importing a dialog table that has
    menus in it.
4.  Fixed a lot of bugs that could occur if the Menu Editor was hidden, eg. ID
    conflicts, menus losing styles, etc.
5.  Fixed Dialog Studio not detecting duplicate control names on project load.
6.  Fixed Copy Dialog Code not working in all situations.
    

2/16/2002 - 1.0 beta 8 (mIRC 6+)
1.  The position of the design dialog is really saved now.  Honestly.  So is the
    menu editor.  Also, removed some "flicker" when Dialog Studio is first
    loaded.
2.  Renamed Object Palette to Tool Box and Object Browser to Properties Browser.
    As such, the shortcut for the Tool Box is now ALT+O.
3.  New toolbar icons!  Yay!  Also, removed toolbar icon for Preferences.  It is
    now only available from the Edit menu or CTRL+R.
4.  View Dialog Code and Copy Dialog Code now have their own toolbar icon rather
    than the drop-down menu.
5.  Fixed menu items not remembering ID numbers.
6.  Added user prompts when deleting controls.  This should prevent you from
    accidentally deleting a large number of controls.  The prompts can be
    disabled by going to Preferences > Miscellaneous > Deletion Prompts.
7.  Added the ability to export dialog tables directly to .mrc, or .txt files. 
    Use File > Export or ALT+E.
8.  Fixed Access Violation when adding scrollbars with defaults set, and now you
    can't set invalid combinations, such as "Vertical" and "Bottom".
9.  Fixed improper handling of scrollbar type/align in Properties Browser with
    more than one scrollbar selected.
10. Fixed Move Up/Move Down not updating the Preview in Menu Editor.
11. Fixed problem with icons not setting the correct X position from the
    Properties Browser.
12. Added support for local (dialog -l) dialog tables.
13. Added support for 'flat' and 'multi' button styles.
14. Added support for 'nowrap' text control style.
15. Added support for 'range N N' scroll control style.
16. Added support for 'limit N' combo box control style.
17. Added support for 'option notheme' dialog option to disable Windows XP's
    visual styles.
18. Fixed wordwrapping and painting bugs with Auto-fit text control.
19. Fixed menu area on design dialog not painting properly after resize.  Also,
    Dialog Studio dialog heights now match mIRC 6 dialog heights (they were
    different because of a change to mIRC 6).
20. Fixed Access Violation when exiting Dialog Studio minimized via the taskbar
    right-click "Close."
21. Added errorlog.txt error logging system.  If you get an error, such as an
    Access Violation, you can email this file to me, which will help me in
    debugging the problem.
22. Added the ability to dock the Tool Box.  The options are available on the
    right-click menu of the Tool Box.
23. Improved the logic of the automatic control naming.  Made a few changes:

      * No two controls can have the same name.
      * Names are limited to 100 characters.
      * Names can only contain alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) and underscore (_)
        characters.
        
    If you load an older project that violates these, it will automatically be
    renamed to a suitable name.  You may not use the name 'tabcontrol' because
    this is reserved for the tab control.
24. Fixed Clear button in the Import from Clipboard window not positioning
    properly if you resized the window.
25. Added 'F' font-toggle keyboard shortcut.  This will toggle the font of the
    design dialog between Tahoma and MS Sans Serif.  Since Windows 2K/XP use
    Tahoma and 95/98/ME use MS Sans Serif, this will let you see what your
    dialog looks like under both.  When you preview, however, it will still use
    the system default.  This setting is not saved...
26. Fixed Import from Clipboard and View Dialog Code windows acting like morons
    under Windows XP when resizing the windows.
27. Added Copy Table and Close buttons to the View Dialog Code window.
28. Optimized and organized the internal graphics resources.
29. You can no longer select two controls on two different tabs.
30. Alternate font changed to Tahoma, size 8.  Sorry, I got tired of that small
    Microsoft Sans Serif. =)
